## GitHub Actions Workflow

The provided GitHub Actions workflow automates the following:

- Installs necessary dependencies (including the Lightning SDK).
- Creates a Lightning.ai Studio with a free T4 GPU.
- Clones your GitHub repository and installs the dependencies.
- Runs your model training script remotely on the GPU.
- Stops and deletes the studio after training is complete.

This workflow enables **CI/CD model training** using free GPU resources, helping to save costs while speeding up the training process.
